## 4. 支付问题处理

```
Hello! I see there might be an issue with your payment for this order. Please double-check that your card information, billing address, and available balance are correct in your Amazon account.

## 5. 订单修改

**适用场景：** 客户要求修改订单信息

```
Hello! I understand you would like to change your order details. Once an Amazon order is in processing or shipped status, we usually cannot directly modify the items or quantities. If your order has not been shipped yet, you can try to cancel it in "Your Orders" and place a new order with the correct information. If it has already been shipped, please let us know your specific request and we will suggest the best solution for you.

## 6. 地址确认

**适用场景：** 发货前确认客户收货地址

```
Hello! I wanted to confirm your shipping address before we ship your order. The address on file is: [Address]. Is this correct? If you need to update it, please do so in your Amazon account as soon as possible. Once the order enters the shipping process, we may no longer be able to change the address, and the package will be sent to the address currently shown in your order.
```

## 7. 预计送达时间

**适用场景：** 客户询问预计送达日期

```
Hello! Thank you for your order. Based on your shipping address and the shipping method you selected, your estimated delivery date is [Date]. This is an estimate provided by Amazon and may vary slightly depending on the carrier's actual performance and local conditions. You can always check the latest estimated delivery date on your order details page on Amazon.
```

## 8. 订单状态查询

**适用场景：** 客户询问订单当前状态

```
Hello! I've checked the status of your order [Order Number]. It is currently in the status of [Current Status, e.g. "Preparing for Shipment" / "Shipped"]. You can also view this information in your Amazon account under "Your Orders". If the status does not change for an unusually long time, please let us know and we will help you investigate further.
```

## 9. 合并订单

**适用场景：** 客户希望多个订单合并发货

```
Hello! I see you placed multiple orders and would like to have them shipped together. Whether orders can be combined depends on Amazon's system, warehouse location, and shipping method. If Amazon supports combining them, it will automatically arrange shipment in one package when possible. We, as the seller, generally cannot manually merge orders, but if you tell us your order numbers, we can check and give you more specific information.
```

## 10. 催单处理

**适用场景：** 客户催促发货或送达

```
Hello! I understand you are concerned about the delivery time. I've checked your order and confirmed that it is on the way. We will keep an eye on the tracking information and follow up with the carrier if there are any unusual delays. If the package does not arrive by [Latest Date], please contact us again and we will help you with further solutions, such as replacement or refund according to Amazon's policies.
