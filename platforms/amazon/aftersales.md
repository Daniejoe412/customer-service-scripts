Hello! I understand you would like to exchange your item. On Amazon, exchanges are often handled as a return plus a new order. Please initiate a return request for the current item through your Amazon account, and once the return is accepted, you can place a new order for the item you prefer. If you tell us more about the issue, we can also suggest the most suitable replacement option for you.

If you have any difficulty downloading or printing the label, please let us know.

Hello! I understand the issue you mentioned and I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused.
